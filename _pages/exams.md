The evaluation of the cleverness of our agents consists in a sequence of individual tasks of the same form as a quizz:
Each task comes along with a description and one or two examples.
Then four answers are presented to the agent.
It is also shown that each answer is selected by pushing an associated button available to the agent.
The agent should give his guess for the correct answer by pushing the button corresponding to his guess.

During the exam session, the agent stands in a room.
On one wall of the room are projected images or videos.
Sound can also be broadcast.
Then, four buttons are placed at the center of the room, each button corresponding to a different answer.
