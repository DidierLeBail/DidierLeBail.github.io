The evaluation of the degree of cleverness of our agents consists in a sequence of individual tasks of the same form as a quizz:
each task comes along with a description and one or two examples.
Then four answers are presented to the agent.
It is also shown that each answer can be selected by pushing a button.
The agent should give his guess for the correct answer by pushing the button corresponding to his guess.

During the exam session, the agent stands in a room.
On one wall of the room are projected images or videos.
Sound can also be broadcast.
Four buttons are placed at the center of the room, each button corresponding to a different answer.
