Embodiement has a lot of advantages:

* more suited to develop intuitive knowledge about physics
* data have only a few types: sensory (auditive, visual, etc) or motor ; then the same agent can handle any problem immersed in the same world. This is in contrast with non-embodied algorithms, which are wired to receive only numbers or images as input: depending on the problem, their input and output layers need to be re-defined.
* active learning: agents are able to act on the world to design experiences in order to discriminate between models of their world, which is not possible in the non-embodied setting.
