Three aspects of our agents are subject to genetic evolution:
1. the initial architecture of their neural network
2. the plasticity rules of this network at fixed architecture
3. the rules for changing the architecture (making or removing connections between neurons, introduction or removal of neurons in the network)

As our agents are able to learn along their life's course, the algorithm we consider is actually a [memetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetic_algorithm).
