The genetic algorithm we use allows the agents to become better at learning across generations.
Since we consider a combination of genetic search and individual learning, this algorithm is called a [memetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetic_algorithm).

Three aspects of our agents' neural networks are subject to genetic evolution:
1. the initial architecture
2. the plasticity rules at fixed architecture
3. the rules for changing the architecture (making or removing connections between neurons, introduction or removal of neurons in the network, etc)

Although this is not yet implemented, we would like to consider Lamarckian learning, meaning that some skills that an agent learns through his life are transferred back to the genome of his offspring.
