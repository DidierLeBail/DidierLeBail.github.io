What we call an agent is the data of a body and a neural network controlling that body.
In addition to that, an agent encounters three stages of development:
(1) prenatal, (2) child and (3) adult.

The benefit of having three stages is to allow the agent's brain to develop for longer.

### prenatal
In the prenatal stage, external sensory inputs (vision and hearing) are disabled, but interal inputs are activated.
This encompasses food level, oxygen level, life points and inventory content.
The agent is not allowed to move by itself, meaning that the state of the motoneurons is not converted into motor commands acting upon the agent's body.
However, those motoneurons are not frozen:
their state evolves because of their connexion with the remainder of the network.

The agent is physically tied to one of its parents chosen at random.
The parent that is bearing the newborn agent is called the "mother".
However, there is no sexual differentiation between agents:
any agent can successfully copulate with any other one.

In the prenatal stage, the agent does not cost any energy to the mother:
its food level is automatically replenished when it drops too low.
The very existence of the prenatal agent is hidden to every other agent, except to the mother:
The brain of her is interfaced with the neural network of the prenatal agent via specialized neurons called the teacher neurons.

### child
In the child stage, the agent does not benefit from automatic food replenishment anymore.
However, it cannot forage food by itself, because it is still physically tied to its mother.
It can only be fed by the adult agents.
Its survival at this stage depends on its ability to convince adult agents to feed him.
