We summarize here the estimated timeline for the realization of the phase 4, whose goal is to implement the concept of artificial brain.
To read a motivation and a more detailed description of the intermediate steps, we refer to [this document](/_teaching/phase_4.md).
Below, you will find the timeline and only a short description of each step involved.

# step 1
Title: the input and output channels\
Goal: precise which sensory information is sent to the brain, how this info is preprocessed and which motor output is sent to the world\
Duration: 1 week

# step 2
Title: the sensory modules\
Goal: implement multiple parallel pathways to process the same sensory input, with modulation of these pathways by other modules in the brain\
Duration: 2 weeks

# step 3
Title: basic symbolic components\
Goal: make available to the brain various symbolic processing components\
Duration: 2 weeks

# step 4
Title: the synaptic network\
Goal: implement various types of neurons\
Duration: 1 week

# step 5
Title: beyond synaptic communication\
Goal: implement both a parasynaptic network and a protocol for node-to-node long-range communication in the synaptic network\
Duration: 2 weeks

# step 6
Title: plasticity\
Goal: enables the brain parameters to evolve in a context-dependent way, also enables to change the way these parameters evolve\
Duration: 3 weeks

# step 7
Title: the observer module\
Goal: make available to the brain statistics about its own dynamics and global structure\
Duration: 3 weeks

# step 8
Title: accessing local variables\
Goal: internal computations of a neuron are available to its neighbors\
Duration: 1 week
