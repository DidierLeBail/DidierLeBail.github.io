We summarize here the estimated timeline for the realization of the phase 4, whose goal is to implement the concept of artificial brain.
To read a motivation and a more detailed description of the intermediate steps, we refer to [this document](/teaching/phase_4).
Below, you will find the timeline and only a short description of each step involved.

# step 1: the input and output channels
Duration: 1 week\
Goal: precise which sensory information is sent to the brain, how this info is preprocessed and which motor output is sent to the world

# step 2: the sensory modules
Duration: 2 weeks\
Goal: implement multiple parallel pathways to process the same sensory input, with modulation of these pathways by other modules in the brain

# step 3: basic symbolic components
Duration: 2 weeks\
Goal: make available to the brain various symbolic processing components

# step 4: the synaptic network
Duration: 1 week\
Goal: implement various types of neurons

# step 5: beyond synaptic communication
Duration: 2 weeks\
Goal: implement both a parasynaptic network and a protocol for node-to-node long-range communication in the synaptic network

# step 6: plasticity
Duration: 3 weeks\
Goal: enables the brain parameters to evolve in a context-dependent way, also enables to change the way these parameters evolve

# step 7: the observer module
Duration: 3 weeks\
Goal: make available to the brain statistics about its own dynamics and global structure

# step 8: accessing local variables
Duration: 1 week\
Goal: internal computations of a neuron are available to its neighbors
